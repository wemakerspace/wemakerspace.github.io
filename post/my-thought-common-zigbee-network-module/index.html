              <p>There so many Zigbee device out there in the market. Which one of them is better? What technology stack they use? Here is my research on the common Zigbee module that you can from the market. ðŸ¤—</p>

<h1 id="sonoff-zigbee-product">Sonoff Zigbee Product</h1>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://wemaker.space/post-images/1628560677261.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="chipset-design">Chipset design:</h2>
<p>Sonoff Zigbee module (all the 4 type out there except the bridge) using the super old 2009 TI-2530 chip.</p>
<p>CC2530 CPU is 8051 8 bit, 8KB flash. With -97dBm sensitivity and max 4.5dBm output.</p>
<p>Looking at the power saving feature, Zigbee RX power consumption is 25mA. TX power is 35mA @ 4.5dBm.<br>
even at low power mode, CC2530 is around 400nA.</p>
<h2 id="board-design">Board design:</h2>
<p>The capacitor is a bit small, mean the sustainable transmit rate will be lower too if you use low quality CR2032 battery.</p>
<p>Next the antenna design is not optimized, there are a weird corner at the beginning of the track.</p>
<p>The test point also seem to be just testing the board function only and no JTAG connection. Mean the CC2530 firmware was burn in before solder.</p>
<h2 id="firmware">Firmware:</h2>
<p>Due to very little flash size left, you only using Zigbee HA 1.2 feature. And very limited firmware feature can be put inside there. It really just a basic unit.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict:</h2>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Cheap. Locally available.<br>
<strong>Con:</strong> using older 8 bit chipset, limited function, battery life around 0.5-1 year.</p>
<h1 id="aqara-zigbee-product-lumi">Aqara Zigbee Product (Lumi)</h1>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://wemaker.space/post-images/1628560794731.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="chipset-design-2">Chipset design:</h2>
<p>Aqara sensor use NXP JN5169 chip. They also been doing this longer time using NXP chip since their first product (Lumi in China)</p>
<p>NXP JN5169 is a 32 bit RISC chip, 32KB ram and 512KB Flash with max 10dBm output.<br>
Looking at the power saving feature, Zigbee RX power consumption is 13mA. TX power is 20mA @ 10dBm.</p>
<p>At low power mode, JN5169 is around 120nA.</p>
<p>The battery atleast can last 3 time longer and range is 2-3 time better.</p>
<h2 id="broad-design">Broad design:</h2>
<p>CE tested board, RoHS certified with lot of test pin.</p>
<p>Proper 2.4GHz optimized antenna (patented). Beefy tantalum capacitor. Come with Panasonic CR2032.</p>
<p>A much bigger crystal also suggest more stable operation. And JN5169 have build in temperature probe (not accurate)</p>
<p>The board is fully tested and the JTAG pinout at the back suggest this board firmware is loaded after manufacturing.</p>
<h2 id="firmware-2">Firmware:</h2>
<p>With the upgrade of Aqara Gateway M2, all Aqara devuce can use Zigbee 3.0 now.</p>
<p>Due to bigger flash size, more firmware feature can be write in. And Aqara update their firmware quite frequent.</p>
<h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict:</h2>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Long range, long battery life (2 year), more stable<br>
<strong>Con:</strong> Slightly expensive. earlier NXP firmware don't play well with CC2530 based router. Now better d.</p>
<h1 id="tuya-zigbee-product">Tuya Zigbee Product</h1>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://wemaker.space/post-images/1628561306940.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h2 id="chipset-design-3">Chipset design:</h2>
<p>They have quite a number of module using different MCU.</p>
<p>I had see the latest one using silabs EFR32 ARM-M33 one, that one quite powerful MCU but the firmware is the same limited feature with their lower end module. I already reserved that to hack my own EMBERNET Z-stack on it rather than the Tuya OS.</p>
<p>The common module TYZS1L/TYZS4/TYZS5 are all Silicon labs EFR32 model. but all have different ram / flash side.</p>
<p>Running on Arm cortex M4 core, they are quite powerful, however, the way Tuya RTOS run on top of them mean their feature will be limited.</p>
<h2 id="board-design-2">Board design:</h2>
<p>Manufacturer will buy Tuya module, and follow a fixed tuya API they can use to talk to the device. So power saving feature or extra functionality is pretty much not existed here.</p>
<p>They do however has a faster hardware and the antenna tuning seem to be much better on newer module.</p>
<h2 id="firmware-3">Firmware:</h2>
<p>Manufacturer can't really change much of the Tuya RTOS design as they purchase from Tuya the module loaded with default firmware.</p>
<p>My main concern is, even tuya make good Zigbee communication device, it doesn't mean the build quality of the rest of the product will be good as well. I seem many low quality tuya product been made. Tuya only supply the network module and the cloud service, the rest of the hardware and testing is done by the manufacturer themselves. And most of them is bad.</p>
<h2 id="verdict-3">Verdict:</h2>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Many kind of device. Work on Tuya ecosystem. Pretty okay Network range.<br>
<strong>Con:</strong> Not custom feature, bad quality product. U dunno which version of Tuya module you get and very low chance get firmware update.</p>
